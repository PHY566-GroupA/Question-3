\begin{abstract}
A random walk is a mathematical formalization of a path that consists of a succession of random steps. The term random walk was first introduced by Karl Pearson in 1905.  Random walks have been used in many fields: ecology, economics, psychology, computer science, physics, chemistry, and biology.  Random walks explain the observed behaviors of many processes in these fields, and thus serve as a fundamental model for the recorded stochastic activity. 

One of the main applications of randolm walk is to trace the path of a molecule as it travels in a liquid or gas. These molecules are constantly buffeted by the molecules around them, a consequence of the molecular nature of matter. They exhibit random walks, where each "step" is in a random direction relative to the one that preceeded it.

The type of motion that describes such random motion of particles is known as, Brownian motion. Brownian motion is among the simplest of the continuous-time stochastic (or probabilistic) processes, and it is a limit of both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes.

\section{Introduction}
In the Group Assignment 1, we are asked to use random walks to simulate the mixing of two gases in 2D in a rectangular enclosure. Also, we are asked to understand the variation of linear population densities with select time-intervals. The questions posed in the assignment are as follows - 

\subsection{Mixing of two Gases}
Use the techniques and insights gained previously to write a program to simulate the mixing of two gases in 2D in a rectangular enclosure:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item Set up a 2D grid in xy space with dimensions 600 x 400. Fully populate the left third of the grid with a gas of species ”A” and the right third of the grid with a gas of species ”B”. The center third of the grid remains empty. Pick a random location on the grid, and have the gas particle move at random one position up/down/left/right. If the selected position is occupied, reject the move and pick another particle (you may optimize the algorithm by only picking from occupied sites). Repeat for a large number of iterations. 

\item Plot the linear population densities $n_A (x)$ and $n_B (x)$ after select time-intervals. Also plot a few sample configurations of the grid at various time-steps.

\item Average the densities over 100 trials for added accuracy and replot the densities.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Mixing of two gases}
We generated a grid of size 600 x 400 by populating the left third of the grid with gas species "A" and the right third with a gas species "B", leaving the centre of the grid empty. To pick a random location, that is an occupied site, on the grid we used the "random" function from the 'random' library. 

We considered three different cases to move the randomly selected particle:

\begin{itemize}

\item $Case 1$ - If the particle is at the four corners of the grid, then it has only two degrees of freedom.

\item $Case 2$ - If the particle is along the border of the grid, excluding the edges, then it has three degrees of freedom.

\item $Case 3$ - If the particle is situated within the interior of the gird, then it has all four degree of freedom. 

\end{itemize}

In each case, the particle has an equal probability of moving in it's permissible directions. The random motion of the particles is repeated over a large number of iterations.

Also, the question asked us to plot the linear population densities after select time-intervals. The population densities are calculated by counting the number of gas molecules of types "A" and "B" independently along the x-axis.

For the last part of the question, we average the densities over 100 trials using a "for" loop and replot the densities at various time-steps.
